# self-healing-ai-pipeline
A Python-based autonomous pipeline for dependency monitoring and LLM migration.
* [2026-02-04] Infrastructure: Network bridge connectivity restored. System pending AI pipeline initialization.
# 🤖 Sovereign AI Scout: Agentic Career Pipeline
**Phase 1 of the Self-Healing AI Pipeline Initiative**

### 🛡️ SecOps & Infrastructure Remediation (2026-02-07)
Today’s deployment focused on hardening the environment substrate and resolving framework-level routing conflicts.

#### **Key Engineering Resolves:**
* **Credential Lifecycle Management:** Identified a potential credential exposure; executed a full **Secret Rotation** of the Gemini API environment and sanitized the local shell history to ensure zero-trace security.
* **Explicit Resource Addressing (404 Resolution):** Resolved a critical `NOT_FOUND` routing error by transitioning from generic model strings to **Version-Pinned Endpoints** (`models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
* **Environment Persistence:** Engineered a persistent configuration layer via `.bashrc` to decouple sensitive API keys from the application logic, facilitating environment-agnostic execution.
* **Framework Override (OpenAI Muffling):** Successfully implemented a `manager_llm` override within the CrewAI orchestration layer, forcing strict adherence to the Google AI ecosystem and eliminating redundant OpenAI fallback loops.

#### **System Architecture:**
- **Logic Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Pinned)
- **Orchestration:** CrewAI (Sequential Process)
- **Substrate:** WSL2 Ubuntu on 8GB RAM
- **Senses:** Serper.dev Real-time Web Search
