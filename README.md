# self-healing-ai-pipeline
A Python-based autonomous pipeline for dependency monitoring and LLM migration.
* [2026-02-04] Infrastructure: Network bridge connectivity restored. System pending AI pipeline initialization.
# 🤖 Sovereign AI Scout: Agentic Career Pipeline
**Phase 1 of the Self-Healing AI Pipeline Initiative**

### 🛡️ SecOps & Infrastructure Remediation (2026-02-07)
Today’s deployment focused on hardening the environment substrate and resolving framework-level routing conflicts.

#### **Key Engineering Resolves:**
* **Credential Lifecycle Management:** Identified a potential credential exposure; executed a full **Secret Rotation** of the Gemini API environment and sanitized the local shell history to ensure zero-trace security.
* **Explicit Resource Addressing (404 Resolution):** Resolved a critical `NOT_FOUND` routing error by transitioning from generic model strings to **Version-Pinned Endpoints** (`models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
* **Environment Persistence:** Engineered a persistent configuration layer via `.bashrc` to decouple sensitive API keys from the application logic, facilitating environment-agnostic execution.
* **Framework Override (OpenAI Muffling):** Successfully implemented a `manager_llm` override within the CrewAI orchestration layer, forcing strict adherence to the Google AI ecosystem and eliminating redundant OpenAI fallback loops.

#### **System Architecture:**
- **Logic Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Pinned)
- **Orchestration:** CrewAI (Sequential Process)
- **Substrate:** WSL2 Ubuntu on 8GB RAM
- **Senses:** Serper.dev Real-time Web Search

*Targeting: AI Automation Architect | Expected Graduation: 2028*
Feb 7, 2026: Modular System Hardening Successfully resolved a critical environment path conflict between Conda and Venv while debugging a 404 API protocol mismatch for Gemini 1.5. Implemented a modular verification harness to isolate LLM connectivity from agent logic, ensuring a deterministic substrate with a verified >1.2Gi RAM safety margin. Moved the pipeline toward a self-healing architecture by enforcing stable v1 API endpoints.
Today, I executed a Zero-Base Reset of my AI development substrate to eliminate persistent "Shell Pollution" and dependency entropy within my WSL Ubuntu environment. I transitioned the project from deprecated wrappers to the 2026 Native Google GenAI SDK, successfully implementing an explicit v1 production handshake that bypassed regional API routing bugs. By purging legacy technical debt and isolating the core execution path, I have established a deterministic foundation for the upcoming self-healing pipeline. This shift from "wrapper-dependent" to "native-direct" architecture ensures maximum stability and performance for my pr
Executed a comprehensive environmental substrate sanitization, purging legacy technical debt to establish a pristine development baseline.
Architectural Shift: Transitioned to a "First-Principles" training methodology, prioritizing system transparency and AI-agnostic proficiency over high-level abstraction.
Trajectory: Currently engineering a self-healing AI pipeline as a foundational step toward a Senior AI Architect role, focused on high-leverage automation and system reliability.
2026-02-10 | Infrastructure Hardening & Environment Reconstruction

System Sanitization: Conducted a full purge of legacy technical debt, reclaiming 2.7GB of storage and neutralizing insecurely hardcoded environmental variables.

Environment Orchestration: Deployed a fresh Miniconda substrate (Python 3.13.11) with header-level shell integration in ~/.bashrc to bypass WSL-specific initialization guard clauses.

Security Audit: Verified 100% removal of plain-text API credentials, transitioning to a .env based secret management strategy for upcoming AI pipeline development
