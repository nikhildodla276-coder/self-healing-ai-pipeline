# AI Self-Healing Pipeline
Execution: Completed a multi-vendor market audit in Raipur to secure high-performance 8GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22 modules, optimizing for dual-channel memory symmetry.
Architecture: Drafted the core event-loop and sentinel-monitoring skeleton for the "Sovereign-Sentinel" pipeline to ensure immediate scalability upon hardware deployment.
Developing an autonomous, self-healing AI pipeline designed for real-time dependency monitoring and seamless LLM model migration. Implementing modular agentic flows to minimize technical debt and ensure 99.9% system uptime in production environments."
Infrastructure Scaling: Successfully integrated and synchronized a 16GB Dual-Channel DDR4 memory architecture to eliminate local LLM inference bottlenecks.

System Optimization: Executed a kernel-level memory purge and re-calibrated virtual memory paging files for high-throughput AI pipeline orchestration.

Terminal Autonomy: Transitioned to a command-line-first workflow for repository management and system diagnostics.
