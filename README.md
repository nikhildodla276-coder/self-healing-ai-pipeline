# AI Self-Healing Pipeline
Execution: Completed a multi-vendor market audit in Raipur to secure high-performance 8GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22 modules, optimizing for dual-channel memory symmetry.
Architecture: Drafted the core event-loop and sentinel-monitoring skeleton for the "Sovereign-Sentinel" pipeline to ensure immediate scalability upon hardware deployment.
Developing an autonomous, self-healing AI pipeline designed for real-time dependency monitoring and seamless LLM model migration. Implementing modular agentic flows to minimize technical debt and ensure 99.9% system uptime in production environments."
Infrastructure Scaling: Successfully integrated and synchronized a 16GB Dual-Channel DDR4 memory architecture to eliminate local LLM inference bottlenecks.

System Optimization: Executed a kernel-level memory purge and re-calibrated virtual memory paging files for high-throughput AI pipeline orchestration.

Terminal Autonomy: Transitioned to a command-line-first workflow for repository management and system diagnostics.
Engineered the Shadow Sentinel: Developed a Python-based automation daemon utilizing Event-Driven Architecture (Observer Pattern) for real-time file system monitoring.

Resilience Optimization: Successfully diagnosed and resolved a WinError 32 Race Condition by implementing a synchronization buffer to handle file-locking latency.

System Governance: Deployed the solution within an isolated Virtual Environment to ensure dependency integrity and system portability.
Engineered the Shadow Sentinel: Deployed a Python-based automation daemon utilizing Event-Driven Observer patterns for real-time file system governance.

Resilience Engineering: Diagnosed and mitigated WinError 32 Race Conditions by implementing a synchronization buffer to ensure multi-process stability.

DevOps Best Practices: Established a Sovereign Development Environment via isolated venv architecture to maintain strict dependency control and portability.
​I specialize in the architectural design of self-healing AI ecosystems and multi-agent orchestrations. My work focuses on eliminating manual technical debt by deploying autonomous 'Shadow Agents' that monitor, diagnose, and repair enterprise-grade pipelines in real-time. I don't just build models; I build the infrastructure that allows AI to operate with 99.9% autonomy, ensuring that system intelligence scales without human bottlenecks.
